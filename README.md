Replace with your API key from a currency exchange API

API Service: For this example, we used https://api.exchangerate-api.com/, which does not require an API key for basic usage. If you prefer a different API that requires an API key, you can use services like:

Open Exchange Rates
CurrencyLayer
Fixer.io

Error Handling: Improve error messages and handle different types of errors gracefully.
Currency Symbols: Display currency symbols along with names for better UX.
Historical Data: Add functionality to view historical exchange rates.
Conversion History: Store and display recent conversions.
